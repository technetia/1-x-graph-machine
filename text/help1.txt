Overview

Graph

-- Enter your functions (in terms of x) in the given spaces.
-- You do not need to use all the given spaces.
-- Next to each given space is a button with a color. Each function uses the color next to it.
-- Use the left mouse button to cycle through the colors.
-- Once your functions are graphed:
   -- Press Esc to return.
   -- Press the left mouse button to toggle the coordinate indicator on/off.
   -- Press the tilde (~) to create an image of the current graph.
   -- Images are saved in the same directory as the program.

Settings

-- NOTE: All settings are saved permanently until changed.
-- Grid: turns grid on/off
-- Axes: turns x- and y-axes on/off
-- Graph animation: turns on/off delay in plotting graphs
-- x_left, x_right: max left and right coordinates of graph (x_right must be > x_left)
-- y_top, y_bottom: max top and bottom coordinates of graph (y_top must be > y_bottom)
-- x_inc, y_inc: distance between grid lines (must be > 0)


-- If you're confused, experimentation is your friend.
