To run the program:
- If using the source, run the main file. (1-x_graph_machine.pyw) Python 2.5-2.7 and Pygame are required. (If running from the command line, you will need to type something like "python 1-x_graph_machine.pyw")
- If creating a Windows executable, run as you would anything else.

Command-line parameters:
- Any additional command-line parameters will be combined into one and interpreted as a function, which will then be graphed immediately, bypassing the normal menu functions. (Useful for quick graphing.)

To use the program:
- Refer to the help section in the program for details. If ever in doubt, experimentation is your friend, or contact me (details on my website).
